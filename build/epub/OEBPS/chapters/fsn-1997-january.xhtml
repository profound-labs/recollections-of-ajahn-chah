<p><em>Issue 39, published in January 1997.</em></p>

<p><em>These Dhamma reflections were published to commemorate the fifth
anniversary of Luang Por Chah’s death. They come from a collection of
his teachings assembled by Paul Breiter during the 70’s. They are
presented as an expression of reverence and gratitude.</em></p>

<p>Everyone knows suffering – but they don’t really understand suffering.
If we really understood suffering, then that would be the end of our
suffering.</p>

<p>Westerners are generally in a hurry, so they have greater extremes of
happiness and suffering. The fact that they have many <em>kilesas</em>
(defilements) can be a source of wisdom later on.</p>

<p>To live the lay life and practise Dhamma, one must be in the world but
remain above it. <em>Sīla</em>, beginning with the basic five precepts, is the
all-important parent of all good things. It is for removing all wrong
from the mind, removing that which causes distress and agitation. When
these basic things are gone, the mind will always be in a state of
<em>samādhi</em>. At first, the basic thing is to make <em>sīla</em> really firm.
Practise formal meditation when there is the opportunity. Sometimes it
will be good, sometimes not. Don’t worry about it, just continue. If
doubts arise, just realize that they, like everything else in the mind,
are impermanent.</p>

<p>From this base <em>samādhi</em> will come, but not yet wisdom. One must watch
the mind at work – see like and dislike arising from sense contact, and
not attach to them. Don’t be anxious for results or quick progress. An
infant crawls at first, then learns to walk, then to run, and when it is
full grown, can travel half-way round the world to Thailand.</p>

<p><em>Dāna</em> (generosity), if given with good intention, can bring happiness
to oneself and others. But until <em>sīla</em> is complete giving is not pure,
because we may steal from one person and give to another.</p>

<p>Seeking pleasure and having fun is never-ending, one is never satisfied.
It’s like a water jar with a hole in it. We try to fill it but the water
is continually leaking out. The peace of the religious life has a
definite end, it puts a stop to the cycle of endless seeking. It’s like
plugging up the hole in the water jar!</p>

<p>Living in the world, practising meditation, others will look at you like
a gong which isn’t struck, not producing any sound. They will consider
you useless, mad, defeated; but actually it is just the opposite.</p>

<p>As for myself, I never questioned the teachers very much, I have always
been a listener. I would listen to what they had to say, whether it was
right or wrong did not matter; then I would just practise. The same as
you who practise here. You should not have all that many questions. If
one has constant mindfulness, then one can examine one’s own mental
states – we don’t need anyone else to examine our moods.</p>

<p>Once when I was staying with an Ajahn, I had to sew myself a robe. In
those days there weren’t any sewing machines, one had to sew by hand and
it was a very trying experience. The cloth was very thick and the
needles were dull; one kept stabbing oneself with the needle, one’s
hands became very sore and blood kept dripping on the cloth. Because the
task was so difficult I was anxious to get it done. I became so absorbed
in the work that I didn’t even notice I was sitting in the scorching
sun, dripping with sweat.</p>

<p>The Ajahn came over to me and asked why I was sitting in the sun and not
in the cool shade. I told him that I was really anxious to get the work
done. ‘Where are you rushing off to?’ he asked. ‘I want to get this job
done so that I can do my sitting and walking meditation,’ I told him.
‘When is our work ever finished?’ he asked. Oh …! This finally brought
me around.</p>

<p>‘Our worldly work is never finished,’ he explained. ‘You should use such
occasions as this as exercises in mindfulness, and then when you have
worked long enough, just stop. Put it aside and continue your sitting
and walking practice.’</p>

<p>Now I began to understand his teaching. Previously, when I sewed, my
mind also sewed, and even when I put the sewing away my mind still kept
on sewing. When I understood the Ajahn’s teaching I could really put the
sewing away. When I sewed, my mind sewed; then when I put the sewing
down, my mind put the sewing down also. When I stopped sewing, my mind
also stopped sewing.</p>

<p>Know the good and the bad in travelling or in living in one place. You
don’t find peace on a hill or in a cave; you can travel to the place of
the Buddha’s enlightenment without coming any closer to enlightenment.
The important thing is to be aware of yourself, wherever you are,
whatever you’re doing. <em>Viriya</em>, effort, is not a question of what you
do outwardly, but just the constant inner awareness and restraint.</p>

<p>It is important not to watch others and find fault with them. If they
behave wrongly, there is no need to make yourself suffer. If you point
out to them what is correct and they don’t practise accordingly, leave
it at that. When the Buddha studied with various teachers, he realized
that their ways were lacking but he didn’t disparage them. He studied
with humility and respect for the teachers, he practised earnestly and
realized their systems were not complete, but as he had not yet become
enlightened, he did not criticize or attempt to teach them. After he
found enlightenment, he recalled those he had studied and practised with
and wanted to share his new-found knowledge with them.</p>

<p>We practise to be free of suffering, but to be free of suffering does
not mean just to have everything as you would like it, have everyone
behave as you would like them to, speaking only that which pleases you.
Don’t believe your own thinking on these matters. Generally, the truth
is one thing, our thinking is another thing. We should have wisdom in
excess of thinking, then there is no problem. When thinking exceeds
wisdom, we are in trouble.</p>

<p><em>Taṇhā</em> (desire) in practice can be friend or foe. At first it spurs us
to come and practise – we want to change things, to end suffering. But
if we are always desiring something that hasn’t yet arisen, if we want
things to be other than they are, then this just causes more suffering.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want to force the mind to be quiet, but this effort just
makes it all the more disturbed. Then we stop pushing and <em>samādhi</em>
arises. And then in the state of calm and quiet we begin to wonder,
‘What’s going on? What’s the point of it?’ … and we’re back to agitation
again!</p>

<p>The day before the first <em>Sanghāyanā</em>, one of the Buddha’s disciples
went to tell the Venerable Ānanda: ‘Tomorrow is the Sangha council, only
<em>arahants</em> may attend.’ Venerable Ānanda was at this time still
unenlightened. So he determined, ‘Tonight I will do it.’ He practised
strenuously all night, seeking to become enlightened. But he just made
himself tired. So he decided to let go, to rest a bit as he wasn’t
getting anywhere for all his efforts. Having let go, as soon as he lay
down and his head hit the pillow, he became enlightened.</p>

<p>External conditions don’t make you suffer, suffering arises from wrong
understanding. Feelings of pleasure and pain, like and dislike, arise
from sense-contact – you must catch them as they arise, not follow them,
not give rise to craving and attachment, which in turn cause mental
birth and becoming. If you hear people talking it may stir you up – you
think it destroys your calm, your meditation; but you hear a bird
chirping and you don’t think anything of it, you just let it go as
sound, not giving it any meaning or value.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t hurry or rush your practice, but must think in terms of a
long time. Right now we have ‘new’ meditation; if we have ‘old’
meditation, then we can practise in every situation, whether chanting,
working, or sitting in out huts. We don’t have to go seeking for special
places to practise. Wanting to practise alone is half right, but also
half wrong. It isn’t that I don’t favour a lot of formal meditation
(<em>samādhi</em>), but one must know when to come out of it – after seven
days, two weeks, one month, two months – and then return to relating to
people and situations again. This is where wisdom is gained; too much
<em>samādhi</em> practice has no advantage other than that one may become mad.
Many monks wanting to be alone have gone off and just died alone!</p>

<p>Having the view that formal practice is the complete and only way to
practise, disregarding one’s normal life situation, is called being
intoxicated with meditation.</p>

<p>Meditation is giving rise to wisdom in the mind. This we can do
anywhere, any time and in any posture.</p>
